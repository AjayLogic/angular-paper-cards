# angular-paper-cards
Paper cards to lay out angular applications and their architecture.

## How to use

1. download PDF, print it and cut out the cards
2. take a card, fill in the boxes as needed
3. place on the wall or floor to form your application
4. hold your chin, tilt your head to a thinking position, point to something, talk to someone, and change it
5. go to 1.

It's not about perfection, it's about communication and understanding.
